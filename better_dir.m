function files = better_dir(folder, extension)

% BETTER_DIR lists files in a directory and returns only files with the
% specified extension.
% FILES = BETTER_DIR(FOLDER,EXTENSION) returns a structure containing the
% names of all files in the specified directory that match the specified
% extions.
% FOLDER is a string containing the path to the directory, and EXTENSION is
% a string containing the desired file extension (e.g., 'txt','mat','csv',
% etc.). It also works with longer file endings, say that you want to
% return all files that end with "log_file.txt." Then simply use that in
% place of 'extension.'

% The code for this function was adapted by Jonas Håkansson from a
% suggestion by ChatGPT, an AI language model trained by OpenAI. Date

% List all files in the directory
all_files = dir(folder);

% filter for only files with the specified extension
files = all_files(endsWith({all_files.name},extension));
end
